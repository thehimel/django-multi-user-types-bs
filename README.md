## User Types
A company having 2 types of users: Employee and Manager.

allauth has default SignupForm, SignupView. Do not override it. Let it be remain at accounts/signup. And do not change the signup form in the settings.py for allauth - it will override the save method and won't allow our employee and manager signup views to save anything extra.

We have customized the following files for the tasks below.
users/forms/, users/views/, templates/users

1. Employee
Create custom signup form for employee.
Create custom signup view for employee.
You must use a custom template in this signup view.

2. Manager
Create custom signup form for manager.
Create custom signup view for manager.
You must use a custom template in this signup view.

## Frontend
MDB-Free_4.19.1 with Boostrap 4 is used for frontend. [Link](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/getting-started/download/)

Design of base.html
It was designed with the index.html file from mbd4 and allauth base.html.

Integrate MDB4 with all the html files inside templates/account.
The account folder is downloaded from the template directory of allauth github repository.

## Deletion of Files Changed by the User
You use django-cleanup to remove files when user updates a filefiled. [Link](https://pypi.org/project/django-cleanup/)
Files used in defaults won't get deleted.

You can also use django-unused-media when you already have junk files. [Link](https://pypi.org/project/django-unused-media/)
This is a command line tool that can delete unused files.

## Important Note
In the database, you must rename the site to include your site_name in emails.
You must change the default email_confirmation_subject. Changing a little bit will be enough. Otherwise it will add [example.com] in the subject.

'src/templates/account/email/email_confirmation_subject.txt'
Default: Please Confirm Your E-mail Address
Customized: Please Confirm The E-mail Address
